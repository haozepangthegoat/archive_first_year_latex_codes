This experiment consists of 2 parts. In the first part, we estimated the viscosity, $\eta$ of Helium and Argon in the laminar flow regime, where viscosity is a property associated with the velocity gradient of gases. Our calculated values are $\eta_{He}= 9 \cdot 10^{-6} \pm 1.29 \cdot 10^{-2} \si{\newton\cdot\second\per\metre^2}$ for Helium and $\eta_{Ar}= 4.1 \times 10^{-5}  \si{\newton\cdot\second\per\metre^2}$ for Argon.  In the second part, we computed the pumping speed, a property associated with the rate of gas flow, in a molecular flow environment. Our results are, $S_{He}= 3 \pm 10 \si{\meter^3\per\second}$ for Helium and $S_{Ar}= 2 \pm 10 \si{\meter^3\per\second}$ for Argon.
In both parts of the experiment, our estimation is not precise due to the low resolution of the pressure gauge employed. However, if assuming the actual value of pressure lies in the centre of our error bar, the calculated value is reasonably accurate compared to some reference data.
