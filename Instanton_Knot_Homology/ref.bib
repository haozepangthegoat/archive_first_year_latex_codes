The aim of the present article is to exhibit stronger restrictions on such knots, arising from knot Floer homology. One consequence is that the non-zero coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of such a knot are $\pm$1. This information can in turn be used to prove that certain lens spaces are not obtained as integral surgeries on knots. In fact, combining our results with constructions of Berge, we classify lens spaces L(p, q) which arise as integral surgeries on knots in S 3 with |p| 1500. Other applications include bounds on the four-ball genera of knots admitting lens space surgeries (which are sharp for Berge's knots), and a constraint on three-manifolds obtained as integer surgeries on alternating knots, which is closely to related to a theorem of Delman and Roberts.},

Furthermore, we functorially assign isomorphisms to (based) diffeomorphisms, and show that this assignment is isotopy invariant. The proof relies on finding a simple generating set for the fundamental group of the "space of Heegaard diagrams," and then showing that Heegaard Floer homology has no monodromy around these generators. In fact, this allows us to give sufficient conditions for an arbitrary invariant of multi-pointed Heegaard diagrams to descend to a natural invariant of 3-manifolds, links, or sutured manifolds.},

These perturbations give us a concrete local method for making the moduli spaces of flat singular SO.3/ connections relevant to Kronheimer and Mrowka's singular instanton knot homology nondegenerate. The mechanism for this study is a (Lagrangian) intersection diagram which arises, through restriction of representations, from a tangle decomposition of a knot. When one of the tangles is trivial, our perturbations allow us to study isolated intersections of two Lagrangians to produce minimal generating sets for singular instanton knot homology. The (symplectic) manifold where this intersection occurs corresponds to the traceless character variety of the four-punctured 2-sphere, which we identify with the familiar pillowcase. We investigate the image in this pillowcase of the traceless representations of tangles obtained by removing a trivial tangle from 2-bridge knots and torus knots. Using this, we compute the singular instanton homology of a variety of torus knots. In many cases, our computations allow us to understand nontrivial differentials in the spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to singular instanton homology.},

If {\$}M{\$} is such a manifold, we show that the type D structure {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathit{\{}CFD{\}}{\}}{\$} may be viewed as a set of immersed curves decorated with local systems in {\$}\backslashpartial M{\$}. These curves-with-decoration are invariants of the underlying three-manifold up to regular homotopy of the curves and isomorphism of the local systems. Given two such manifolds and a homeomorphism {\$}h{\$} between the boundary tori, the Heegaard Floer homology of the closed manifold obtained by gluing with {\$}h{\$} is obtained from the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the curve-sets. This machinery has several applications: We establish that the dimension of {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathit{\{}HF{\}}{\}}{\$} decreases under a certain class of degree one maps (pinches) and we establish that the existence of an essential separating torus gives rise to a lower bound on the dimension of {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathit{\{}HF{\}}{\}}{\$}. In particular, it follows that a prime rational homology sphere {\$}Y{\$} with {\$}\backslashwidehat{\{}\backslashmathit{\{}HF{\}}{\}}(Y){\textless}5{\$} must be geometric. Other results include a new proof of Eftekhary's theorem that L-space homology spheres are atoroidal; a complete characterisation of toroidal L-spaces in terms of gluing data; and a proof of a conjecture of Hom, Lidman, and Vafaee on satellite L-space knots.},

These morphisms remain unexploited in the literature, perhaps because there is still an open question concerning the naturality of maps induced by general movies.

Specifically, we establish a nonvanishing result for the invariants of symplectic four-manifolds, which leads to new proofs of the indecomposability theorem for symplectic four-manifolds and the symplectic Thom conjecture. As a new application, we generalize the indecomposability theorem to splittings of four-manifolds along a certain class of three-manifolds obtained by plumbings of spheres. This leads to restrictions on the topology of Stein fillings of such three-manifolds. {\textcopyright} 2004 Duke Mathematical Journal.},

Roughly, a complete systems of hyperboxes consists of chain complexes for (some versions of) the link Floer homology of L and all its sublinks, together with several chain maps between these complexes. Further, we introduce a way of presenting closed four-manifolds with b{\_}2{\^{}}+ {\textgreater} 1 by four-colored framed links in the three-sphere. Given a link presentation of this kind for a four-manifold X, we then describe the Ozsvath-Szabo mixed invariants of X in terms of a complete system of hyperboxes for the link.
